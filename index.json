Her research interests range from fundamental cosmological measurements to exoplanet statistics to using machine learning to estimate how much dark matter is in the universe. Her goal is to understand the universe’s beginning, evolution and its ultimate fate. Recently she has been developing novel tools using machine learning to solve astrophysical challenges. Shirley plans, builds and analyzes data from a number of astronomical surveys such as Actacama Cosmology Telescope, Euclid, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Simons Observatory, Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. She has broad expertise in theory, observation and data science, and her significant experience on machine learning for cosmology will deliver plenty of insights to the CVPR audience.\nShirley earned her Ph.D. in astrophysical sciences from Princeton in 2008 and her bachelor’s degrees in computer science and physics from the UC Berkeley in 2004. She was a Chamberlain fellow and a Seaborg fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory before joining CMU in 2011 as an assistant professor. She became the Cooper Siegel Career Development Chair Professor and was appointed associate professor with tenure in 2016. She moved to Lawrence Berkeley Lab as a Senior Scientist in 2016. Since 2011, she has been a primary mentor to more than 15 postdoctoral fellows, six graduate students and 14 undergraduates.\n","date":1618704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618704000,"objectID":"e2e003d3d199a9660949365675d41377","permalink":"/speakers/shirley/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/speakers/shirley/","section":"speakers","summary":"A short summary or title of the talk.","tags":[],"title":"Professor Shirley Ho, Flatiron Institute","type":"speakers"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Speaker bio: Courtney Mario is a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory (Draper Lab) in the Perception and Autonomy Group.
